A LinkedList is a collection of nodes, each node containing data and a reference to the next object. A connected set of nodes and references creates a linked list.
Create a node that contains:
a.	Variable(s) for the data each node will hold. 
b.	Variable as an object of this class, which is the pointer to the next node. The pointer is an object because you can create a reference to another object (another node), by defining a variable whose data type is a class.
d.	Methods to return each data that the nodes hold. 
Create a variable for the head node and initialize to null. 
Create a function to insert new node to the linked list by:
a. If this is the first node in the list, assign the node as the head node. 
b. If the head node is not null, traverse the list from the head node, adding the node to the next empty address. 
Create a function to remove a node.
Create a function to print the data in the nodes.
