Create an array to store elements of the queue, with a int for max queue size. E.g. An array to store customer numbers in the bank, with max size.
Create variables for front, back and number of elements. E.g. You need to know the customer at the front and back positions, and number of customers in the queue.
Create methods to check if the queue is full or empty. E.g. To know if there are no people in the queue, or if the queue is max size.
Create method to add elements to the queue. E.g. Check if queue is full, If not - Add new customer to the back of the queue, add customer number to array, then increase customer count.
Create a method to remove element from the queue. E.g. Check if queue is empty. If not:
 - check if this is the last person in the queue. If yes, then reset front and back counters.
- If this is not the last person, increment front counter to simulate the next person moving to the front of the queue, and decrease the number of customers in the queue.
Create other methods like size, check front item, print queue elements, etc.
Create a Class/method to execute those methods.
