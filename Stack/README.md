Algorithm for a Normal Stack.
Think of a Stack of books, or anything you can arrange in a pile.
Normally, you put books in the pile in this order: first book bottom of the pile and last book top of the pile.
Normally, you remove books in the pile in this order: top book first and bottom book last.
So in a normal stack you start by declaring and creatng the stack size and storage method (.e.g array) e.g. How many books will be in your pile and how will you store them?
Then create methods to check when stack is empty or full. E.g. You will want to know when you have or do not have books in the pile.
Create method to add items to the stack, first checking if the stack is full. E.g. Add books to the pile, first checking if the pile is full, and if pile is full do not add any more books. 
Create method to remove items from stack, first checking if the stack is empty. E.g. Remove books to the pile, first checking if the pile is empty, and if pile is empty do not remove any more books. 
Create other methods like checking stack size, check top item, print stack etc.
Create a Class/method to execute the above methods.
